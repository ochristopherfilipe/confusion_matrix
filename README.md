# Confusion Matrix Learning
This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding and working with confusion matrices, a critical tool for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms.

## Objective
The primary goal of this repository is to provide code examples and explanations on creating, interpreting, and visualizing confusion matrices. It also demonstrates the calculation of common performance metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, and F-score from the confusion matrix.

For detailed code examples and more information, please contact me.
